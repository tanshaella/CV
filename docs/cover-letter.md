# Cover Letter

Dear Mr. XXX,

I have become a self-taught Linux System Administrator for almost four years and continuously deepen my understanding in that area. Recently, I started to expand my skills in others, such as Software Engineering, DevOps, and Cloud Computing. I found out about this mentorship program because I always explore learning resources from The Linux Foundation.

As someone who loves to learn, I see this Hyperledger mentorship program as a good practice for me to contribute to the real project, enhance my skills, and also broaden my blockchain technology knowledge. I have experienced doing Linux System Administration tasks and used Git/GitHub for my personal repositories that contain what I have been learning/writing so far. My first attempt in SysAdmin tasks was dual-booting CentOS and Windows which became my idea to start writing its documentation using GitBook. I have also known a little of Hyperledger Technologies by taking its introductory course by The Linux Foundation on edX. Hence, I want to learn writing documentation seriously and also sharpen my proficiency in using tools like Markdown. I consider that the experience/skills I have told earlier can become my fundamental strength to learn later about any work given in this mentorship program.

By participating in this mentorship program, I wish that I will have knowledge to start my own project and develop networking in open source technology community. I have attached my newest CV for your consideration. Thank you for your time and attention.

Sincerely,

Tan Shaella Suhendro
